# Testing and Swagger and Deployment


Swagger is a popular tool used to describe, document, and consume RESTful APIs. It allows you to define the API's structure, endpoints, request and response types, and other details in a machine-readable format, usually in JSON or YAML. This specification is known as OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger Specification).

To integrate Swagger into a C# project, you can use the Swashbuckle NuGet package. Swashbuckle is a library that automatically generates Swagger documentation for your Web API based on your code and comments.
