## Readings Class 01: Exception Handling

```

-One major benefit of being able to trace the call stack in debugging for absolute beginners is that it provides a clear and detailed overview of the sequence of function or method calls leading up to the point of error. This information helps beginners understand the flow of their program and identify the specific functions or methods involved in the error.


-If I could use try/catch in my day to day life, one exception I would like to "catch" and handle is the "road accidents" exception.


No, there is No downsides to try/catch blocks.


Have you ever been baking a cake and accidentally dropped an eggshell into the batter? It's an unexpected problem that can ruin the entire cake. Well, just like in baking, when we write computer programs, unexpected problems can occur too. These problems are called exceptions.

 

Ariane 5: Lack of Real-World Testing Scenarios: Another mistake made during the production of Ariane 5 was the inadequate consideration of real-world testing scenarios. The testing phase did not include a comprehensive range of possible values and conditions that the rocket might encounter during its flight. As a result, the software was not adequately tested for extreme or unexpected situations, such as the high horizontal velocity that caused the overflow error. Incorporating a wider range of test cases and conducting thorough real-world simulations could have helped identify and address such issues before the rocket's launch.

Therac-25:  Poor User Interface: The Therac-25 had a poorly designed user interface that contributed to the mistakes made by operators. The interface displayed ambiguous error messages, making it difficult for operators to understand and diagnose errors. This led to confusion and incorrect usage, resulting in patients receiving massive radiation overdoses, some of which were fatal.
