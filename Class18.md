# Identity

In ASP.NET Core, identity refers to the built-in authentication and authorization system provided by the framework. It allows you to manage user authentication, user registration, and user roles in your web applications. ASP.NET Core Identity is a robust and extensible system that integrates seamlessly with ASP.NET Core web applications, making it easier to add user-based features to your site.

Key features of ASP.NET Core Identity include:

1. User Authentication: ASP.NET Core Identity supports various authentication mechanisms, such as cookies, tokens, and external providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, etc.). It enables users to log in and log out securely.

2. User Registration: It provides features for user registration, including password hashing, email verification, and account confirmation.

3. User Roles and Claims: You can define roles and assign them to users to manage access control in your application. Additionally, claims can be used to store additional information about users' identities.

4. Password Hashing: ASP.NET Core Identity uses a secure password hashing algorithm to store user passwords, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected.

5. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): You can easily enable two-factor authentication for added security during user logins.

Account Lockout: ASP.NET Core Identity includes account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks on user accounts.

6. Integration with Entity Framework Core: It is built on top of Entity Framework Core, allowing you to store user-related data in a database using the ORM capabilities of EF Core.

To use ASP.NET Core Identity in your project, you need to set it up during project creation or add it later as a package. During the setup, it will create default models, views, and controllers, which you can customize according to your application's requirements.

To get started with ASP.NET Core Identity, you typically need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new ASP.NET Core project or add ASP.NET Core Identity to an existing project using the appropriate NuGet packages.

2. Set up the database context and migrations to store user-related data.

3. Customize the user model if needed and create any additional properties required for your application.

4. Configure services and middleware in Startup.cs to enable ASP.NET Core Identity and set up authentication and authorization options.

5. Use the provided Identity views or create your custom views to handle user registration, login, and other account-related functionalities.

6. Implement role-based authorization to restrict access to specific parts of your application based on user roles.

ASP.NET Core Identity simplifies the process of adding user authentication and authorization to your web application and is widely used in ASP.NET Core projects for managing user identity and access control.
