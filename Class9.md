# LINQ & Delegates


## LINQ

LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) is a powerful feature in C# that allows developers to write queries against various data sources using a unified syntax. It provides a convenient way to perform data manipulation, retrieval, and transformation operations on collections of objects, databases, XML documents, and other data sources.

LINQ provides a consistent query syntax and a set of standard query operators that can be used with different data sources. It allows you to write queries in a declarative style, expressing what you want to retrieve or manipulate rather than specifying how to do it. The compiler then translates these LINQ queries into executable code.

Here's an overview of how LINQ works in C#:

1. Data sources: LINQ supports querying various data sources such as collections (e.g., arrays, lists), databases, XML documents, and more. These data sources should implement the IEnumerable<T> or IQueryable<T> interface.

2. Query syntax: LINQ queries are written using query expressions, which resemble SQL-like syntax. The query expression starts with a from clause that specifies the data source, followed by optional where, orderby, groupby, and select clauses. These clauses help filter, order, group, and project the data respectively.

3. Standard query operators: LINQ provides a rich set of standard query operators that can be used to perform various operations on the data. These operators include Where, OrderBy, Select, GroupBy, Join, Aggregate, and many more. They allow you to filter, sort, project, group, and perform calculations on the data.

4. Deferred execution: LINQ queries use deferred execution, which means that the query is not executed immediately when it is defined. Instead, the query is executed when the result is actually accessed, such as when iterating over the query result or applying an operation like ToList() or Count(). This allows for optimization and efficient use of resources.

## Delegates
Delegates in C# are objects that can reference methods with a particular signature. They provide a way to pass methods as parameters, store them in variables, and invoke them dynamically. Delegates are widely used in event handling and callback scenarios.

Here are some key points about delegates in C#:

1. Declaration: Delegates are declared using the delegate keyword, followed by the return type, name, and parameter list that matches the signature of the methods it can reference. 

2. Method Assignment: Delegates can be assigned references to methods that have compatible signatures. The method being assigned must have the same return type (or void) and parameter list as the delegate. Multiple methods can be assigned to a delegate, creating a multicast delegate.

3. Invocation: Delegates are invoked using the invocation operator () as if they were calling the referenced methods directly. When invoked, all the methods assigned to a multicast delegate are called in the order they were added.
