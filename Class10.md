## Stack:
A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It can be visualized as a stack of plates, where the last plate added is the first one to be removed. In a stack, elements are added and removed from the top, which is known as the "top of the stack." It supports two main operations:

1. Push: This operation adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. Pop: This operation removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.
Additional operations that can be performed on a stack include:

* Peek: This operation returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
* Count: This operation returns the number of elements in the stack.
* Clear: This operation removes all elements from the stack.
Stacks are commonly used in scenarios where the order of processing is important, such as in function calls, expression evaluation, undo-redo operations, and more.

## Queue:
A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It can be visualized as a queue of people waiting in line, where the person who joins first is the first one to leave. In a queue, elements are added at one end called the "rear" and removed from the other end called the "front." It supports two main operations:

1. Enqueue: This operation adds an element to the rear of the queue.
2. Dequeue: This operation removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
Additional operations that can be performed on a queue include:

* Peek: This operation returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
* Count: This operation returns the number of elements in the queue.
* Clear: This operation removes all elements from the queue.
Queues are commonly used in scenarios where the order of arrival is important, such as task scheduling, event handling, print spooling, and more.

Implementation in C#:
In C#, stacks and queues can be implemented using built-in classes from the System.Collections.Generic namespace.

To use a stack, you can instantiate the Stack<T> class, where T represents the type of elements you want to store. Here's an example:

```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Stack<int> stack = new Stack<int>();

        // Pushing elements onto the stack
        stack.Push(10);
        stack.Push(20);
        stack.Push(30);

        // Popping elements from the stack
        while (stack.Count > 0)
        {
            int element = stack.Pop();
            Console.WriteLine(element);
        }
    }
}
```

```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Queue<string> queue = new Queue<string>();

        // Enqueuing elements into the queue
        queue.Enqueue("John");
        queue.Enqueue("Alice");
        queue.Enqueue("Bob");

        // Dequeuing elements from the queue
        while (queue.Count > 0)
        {
            string element = queue.Dequeue();
            Console.WriteLine(element);
        }
    }
}


```
In both examples, the elements are added and removed from the stack and queue, respectively, demonstrating the basic operations supported by these data structures.
