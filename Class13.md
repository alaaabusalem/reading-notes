# Dependency Injection & Repository Design Pattern

## Dependency Injection 

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern commonly used in object-oriented programming, including C#, to facilitate loose coupling and increase the maintainability and testability of software systems. It allows you to invert the control of object creation and dependencies, making your code more modular and easier to manage.

In C#, there are several frameworks and libraries available for implementing dependency injection, such as Microsoft's built-in dependency injection framework (starting from .NET Core 2.1), Autofac, Ninject, and Simple Injector. In this response, I'll provide an example using the built-in Microsoft Dependency Injection framework.
Dependency injection helps decouple your code, making it easier to maintain and test. It promotes the principle of "programming to interfaces" and allows for easy swapping of implementations, enabling modular and flexible software development.

## Repository Design Pattern

The Repository design pattern is a commonly used pattern in software development that provides an abstraction layer between the data access logic and the business logic of an application. It helps to encapsulate the data access code, centralize data access operations, and provides a consistent interface for interacting with the data storage.

By using the Repository pattern, you can separate the concerns of data access and business logic, making your code more modular, maintainable, and testable. It also allows you to easily switch data access technologies or implement caching or other data access optimizations without affecting the rest of your application.
