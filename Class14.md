# Navigation Properties and Routing

## Navigation Properties


In C# .NET Core, navigation properties are an essential feature of Entity Framework Core (EF Core), which is the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) provided by Microsoft. Navigation properties allow you to model relationships between different entities in your database. By defining navigation properties, you can easily navigate between related entities without writing complex SQL queries.

Navigation properties are represented as properties in your entity classes and provide a way to access related entities. There are two main types of navigation properties in EF Core:

1. Single Navigation Property: Represents a one-to-one or many-to-one relationship between entities.

2. Collection Navigation Property: Represents a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship between entities.

## Routing

 routing is a mechanism that maps incoming HTTP requests to specific controller actions in your application. It allows you to define custom URL patterns for your application's endpoints, making the URLs more user-friendly and SEO-friendly. ASP.NET provides a powerful routing system that is part of the ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core frameworks.

 Apps can configure routing using:

* Controllers
* Razor Pages
* SignalR
* gRPC Services
* Endpoint-enabled middleware such as Health Checks.
* Delegates and lambdas registered with routing.
